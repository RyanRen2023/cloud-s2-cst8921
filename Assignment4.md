# Student Evaluation Management System

## Project Background

This project focuses on building a Student Evaluation Management System to help school boards track and manage evaluations for students suspected of having learning disabilities. The goal is to automate the evaluation workflow, support decision-making, and generate exportable reports for administrative use.

The Azure DevOps board is organized into three swim lanes: Data Ingestion, Evaluation Display and Calculation, and Case Export. Each swim lane includes 2–3 tickets that represent real tasks in the system. For example, Data Ingestion handles database design and data validation. Evaluation Display focuses on calculating the student’s support need level and displaying results in a user-friendly dashboard. Case Export includes tasks like generating secure PDF reports.

Each ticket includes detailed descriptions, priority and effort estimates (using Fibonacci values), and aligns with DevOps stages. The board follows a four-column layout: To Do, In Progress, In Review, and Done. This setup demonstrates how DevOps practices can be applied to real-world education problems, improving both workflow and data management.
