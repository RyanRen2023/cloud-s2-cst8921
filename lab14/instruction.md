CST8921 – Cloud Industry Trends
Lab 14 – Create a multi-tier solution by using Azure services
Introduction 
Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you might experience Azure UI changes that occur after the development of this training content. As a result, the lab instructions and lab steps might not align correctly.
Microsoft updates this training course when the community alerts us to needed changes. However, cloud updates occur frequently, so you might encounter UI changes before this training content updates. If this occurs, adapt to the changes, and then work through them in the labs as needed.
Objective
The goal of this lab activity is to familiarize students with the concepts, techniques and cloud data solutions using AWS/Azure/GCP
In this proof of concept, you will create a containerized application to host a web app on Azure, as the source of information for the API. You will then build an API proxy using the Azure API Management capabilities to expose and test your APIs. Developers can query the APIs to test the service and validate its applicability.

Prerequisites:
•	Basic understanding of cloud data warehouse and data lake concepts
•	A computer with internet access 
•	Windows or mac machine
•	Web browser
•	Cloud portal access with any cloud service providers (AWS, Azure, GCP)
